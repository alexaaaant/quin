## Packages

I chose the Google Maps package for maps because it has a great community and great documentation. Also, I didn't use maps much, and this solution was obvious to me.


For testing I chose a react-testing-library + msw stack. In my opinion it is a good choise for testing react applications. These libraries links well.

For Styling I chose a mui. Because it has its own components + emotion under the hood that let us to build app fast.

Of course I already have experience with this stack and this is another point why I chose them :)
